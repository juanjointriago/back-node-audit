##### 3.- Send the Request: Hit send and view the response from your server.
##### 4.- Analyze the Response: Check the status code, response body, and headers to ensure your API behaves correctly.


### dont forget this:
`````The dist folder is the directory where TypeScript transpiles the .ts files into .js files. The dist folder and server.js are generated after running the npm run build command, which compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript as per the configuration in tsconfig.json. This folder is not directly created or modified by the developer; it's managed through the build process controlled by the TypeScript compiler. `````

`````Thatâ€™s the complete guide to setting up a Node.js project with TypeScript. This setup gives you a strong foundation for building robust and maintainable server-side applications.`````
